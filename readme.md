# Django Dockerized API with PostgreSQL

This repository contains a Django project configured to run within Docker containers, providing a seamless development and deployment environment. The project is structured to have two main services: one for the PostgreSQL database and another for the Django API.

## Key Features

- **Dockerized Architecture:**
  - Utilizes Docker to encapsulate the project, ensuring consistency across different environments.
  - Separate containers for the database and Django API for easy scalability and maintenance.

- **Automated Superuser Creation:**
  - During the Docker build process, a superuser is automatically created for easy administration and development.

- **Customizable Environment:**
  - Easily configurable through environment variables for settings such as database credentials and Django superuser details.

- **Django REST Framework (DRF):**
  - Integrates Django with DRF, offering a powerful toolkit for building Web APIs.
  - Includes Django migrations and sessions for efficient data management.
